Developed a full-stack ATM application using Python and Tkinter with the following features:

1. **User Authentication & Security**: Implemented PIN-based authentication with encrypted storage and secure session management.
2. **Account Management**: Enabled deposits, withdrawals, balance checks, secure money transfers, and PIN change functionality.
3. **Real-time Currency Conversion**: Integrated REST API (using `requests` library) for real-time multi-currency exchange.
4. **Data Visualization**: Displayed transaction patterns with Matplotlib (bar charts and pie charts) and transaction history with detailed statements.
5. **Persistent Storage**: Used Pickle for data storage and logging, with error handling and input validation for robust operation.

In order to know the username and pin, run the dumm.py file to access the username and pin, as signup option is not present.
Banking system would have already registered the user with his username and pin, so with that only he can access the atm. Keeping in mind of that, we have not added the functionality of signup for a new customer
